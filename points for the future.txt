 - 1)  Error Handling: Enhance error handling to manage API rate limits, network issues, and other potential errors gracefully.
 - 2)  Time Scheduling: Implement a scheduling mechanism (e.g., using cron jobs or a task scheduler) to periodically update the events and statistics.
 - 3)  Authentication: Add support for multiple authentication tokens to distribute the load and avoid hitting rate limits.
 - 4)  Scalability: Optimize the database schema and queries for better performance with larger datasets.
 - 5)  User Interface: Develop a web-based dashboard to visualize the statistics and provide a more user-friendly experience.
 - 6)  Configuration Management: Use environment variables or a configuration management tool to handle sensitive information and configuration settings.
 - 7)  Testing: Implement unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the application.
 - 8)  Documentation: Expand the documentation to include more detailed setup instructions, usage examples, and API documentation.
 - 9)  Logging: Improve logging to provide more detailed insights into the applicationâ€™s behavior and facilitate debugging.
 - 10)  Security: Implement security best practices, such as input validation and secure storage of sensitive data
