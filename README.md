Objective
The objective of this assignment is to track activities on GitHub using the GitHub Events API. 
The application monitors up to five configurable repositories and generates statistics based on a rolling window of either 
7 days or 500 events, whichever is less. These statistics are made available to end-users via a REST API, showing 
the average time between consecutive events for each combination of event type and repository name.
